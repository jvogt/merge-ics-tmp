#      merge_ics.py: This script will get all .ics files (iCalendar files, as
#                    specified in the RFC 2445 specification), read it and
#                    aggregate all events to a new .ics file. If one of the
#                    sourcefiles is not readable (or is not RFC 2445 compatible),
#                    it will be ignored.
